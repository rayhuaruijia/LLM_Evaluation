The term 653 - 23a must be divisible by 10, meaning its units digit has to be 0. Therefore, 'a' can only be 1, 11, 21, 31, etc.\\n\\nWe can quickly eliminate the possibility of a = 1.

Similarly, the train crosses the second person in 18 seconds, leading to the length of the train being 18(t+s).\\n\\nEquating these two expressions for the train's length, we get:\\n20(t-f) = 18(t+s)\\n2t = 20f + 18s\\nt = 10f + 9s\\n\\nAfter 10 minutes, the train crosses the second person again. Assuming the train's length is 'l', we can express this as l = 600t (since 10 minutes is 600 seconds). \\n\\nFinally, to find the time it takes for the two people to meet after the train passes, we can use the formula:\\nTime = (l - 600f) / (f + s)\\nThis represents the distance the train traveled minus the distance the first person traveled, divided by the combined speed of both people. \\n\\nSubstituting the values and simplifying:\\nTime = (600t - 600f) / (f + s)\\nTime = [600(10f + 9s) - 600f] / (f + s)\\nTime = 600(10f + 9s - f) / (f + s)\\nTime = 600 9 (f + s) / (f + s)\\nTime = 600 9 seconds\\nTime = 600 9 / 60 minutes\\nTime = 90 minutes\", \"Answer Correct\": \"yes\", \"Explanation Correct\": \"yes\"}\n",

Substituting the value of x, we get:\\n\\n(221k + 43) / 19\\n\\nSince 221 is divisible by 19 (221 = 19 11 + 12), we can rewrite the expression as:\\n\\n(19 11 k + 12k + 43) / 19\\n\\nThe first term (19 11 k) is divisible by 19.

The problem states that the sport formulation contains 3 ounces of corn syrup. Since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 3:12, this means the proportion of corn syrup is 12/(3+12) = 12/15 = 4/5. Therefore, the 3 ounces of corn syrup represents 4/5 of the total volume. The total volume of the sport formulation is then 3 / (4/5) = 3.75 ounces. Since the ratio of flavoring to water is 1:60 in the sport formulation, the proportion of water is 60/(1+60) = 60/61.

Now, to find the combined work time, we take the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual times: 1/(1/15 + 1/7.5) = 1/(1/10) = 10. This means the work will take 10 days if they were working separately for the full time, but since they are working in shifts, it will take 10/2 = 5 days.

      "{\"My Answer\": \"66430\", \"Explanation\": \"The interest rates form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3. We can use the sum of a geometric series formula to calculate the total interest earned. The formula is: S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a = 3, r = 3, and n = 12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: S = 3(1 - 3^12) / (1 - 3) = 531440. This is the total interest earned over the year. To get the interest per month, we divide by 12: 531440 / 12 = 44286.67. Finally, we multiply this by 2 to account for the fact that the interest is compounded monthly: 44286.67 2 = 88573.34.

      "{\"My Answer\": \"40000\", \"Explanation\": \"Let the average annual earnings be x. The businessman earns $26800 in December, decreasing his average annual earnings by $1200. This means his average earnings for the first 11 months were x + 1200. Therefore, the total earnings for the year can be expressed as (x + 1200) 11 + 26800 = 11x + 13200 + 26800 = 11x + 40000. Since the average annual earnings is x, the total earnings can also be expressed as 12x. Equating both expressions for total earnings, we get 11x + 40000 = 12x, which gives us x = 40000.

      "{\"My Answer\": \"90\", \"Explanation\": \"Let x per minute be the speed of C and y per minute be the speed of D. After meeting at a point, C travels for 32 mins and D travels for 50 mins. So distance covered by each of them post point of crossing C = 32x and D = 50y. The distance covered by C and D before they cross each would be distance covered by D and C post crossing respectively. Therefore distance covered by D before he meets C = 32x. Time taken by D cover 32x distance = 32x / y mins. Therefore total time taken by D = 32x / y + 50 mins. We need to find the value of x in terms of y to arrive at the final answer. Total distance = 32x + 50y. Combined speed of C and D = x + y. Therefore time taken before C and D meet en-route = (32x + 50y) / (x + y). Time taken by D to reach the destination after meeting C = 50 mins. Total travel time for D = [(32x + 50y) / (x + y)] + 50 mins. Equate the two equations: 32x / y + 50 = [(32x + 50y) / (x + y)] + 50. (32x + 50y) / y = (82x + 100y) / (x + y). 32x^2 + 50xy + 32xy + 50y^2 = 82xy + 100y^2. 32x^2 + 82xy - 82xy + 50y^2 - 100y^2 = 0. 32x^2 - 50y^2 = 0. 32x^2 = 50y^2. 16x^2 = 25y^2. Taking square root (since x and y denote speed, square root can't be negative): 4x = 5y. y = 4x / 5.

We can achieve this by making 'a' and 'b' as close as possible. Starting with the largest option (74) and working our way down, we find that 70 = 57 + 75. If we try to modify 'a' and 'b' by adding 7 to 'a' and subtracting 5 from 'b', we get 'b' = 0, which is not allowed. Similarly, subtracting 7 from 'a' results in 'a' = 0, which is also not allowed.

Remaining Shepherds: This means the remaining three shepherds (Ram, Rahul, and John) have a total of 22 sheep.\\n\\n4. Ram's Sheep: We know Ram has 3 more sheep than he would have if he had one less sheep than Rahul. This implies Ram has 4 fewer sheep than Rahul (3 + 1 = 4). We can represent this as: Rahul = Ram + 4.\\n\\n5. John's Sheep: John has 3 less sheep than three times the number of Ram's sheep. This can be written as: John = 3 Ram - 3.\\n\\n6. Combining Equations: We now have three equations:\\n Ram + Rahul + John = 22\\n Rahul = Ram + 4\\n John = 3 Ram - 3\\n\\n7. Solving for Ram: We can substitute the values of Rahul and John from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:\\n Ram + (Ram + 4) + (3 Ram - 3) = 22\\n 5 Ram + 1 = 22\\n 5 Ram = 21\\n Ram = 21 / 5 = 4.2\\n\\nSince we can't have a fraction of a sheep, we need to adjust our thinking slightly.

Let's try adjusting our equation for John:\\n John = 3 Ram + 3\\n\\n8. Recalculating: Now, let's substitute the updated equation for John into our main equation:\\n Ram + (Ram + 4) + (3 Ram + 3) = 22\\n 5 Ram + 7 = 22\\n 5 Ram = 15\\n Ram = 15 / 5 = 3\\n\\nTherefore, Ram has 3 sheep.\", \"Answer Correct\": \"yes\", \"Explanation Correct\": \"yes\"}\n"

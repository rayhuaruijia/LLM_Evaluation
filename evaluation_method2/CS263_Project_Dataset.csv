Sally lives 3 miles directly West of Jimmy. Kenny lives 5 miles directly North of Jimmy. What is the distance from Sally’s house and Kenny’s House?,"Due to pythagorean theorem, the answer is the square root of (3^2) + (5^2), or in other words, the square root of 34 which is 6.08 miles. This is due to the fact that a line west and north from Jimmy’s house create a right triangle, where the distance from Sally’s house to Kenny’s house is the hypotenuse."
Create an identity for the expression 2tan𝜃sec𝜃 by rewriting strictly in terms of sine.,"Using the definitions of tan, sec, and the trig identity sin^2(𝜃) + cos^2(𝜃) = 1
We have
2tan𝜃sec𝜃 = 2(sin𝜃/cos𝜃)(1/cos𝜃) = 2sin𝜃/cos^2𝜃 = 2sin𝜃/(1 - sin^2𝜃)

And after substituting (1 - sin^2𝜃) for cos^2𝜃:

2tan𝜃sec𝜃 = 2sin𝜃/(1 - sin^2𝜃)"
Prove that the composition of any two decreasing functions is increasing.,"Let f and g be given decreasing functions. We claim that f ◦ g is increasing. Given numbers x < y, we need to show that (f ◦ g)(x) < (f ◦ g)(y). First note that because g is decreasing, g(x) > g(y) or equivalently g(y) < g(x). Meanwhile, f is decreasing. Applying the definition of “decreasing” to f and the numbers g(y) and g(x), we see that f(g(y)) > f(g(x)) or equivalently (f ◦ g)(x) < (f ◦ g)(y). As x, y were arbitrary numbers satisfying x < y, we’ve shown that f ◦ g is increasing. (And as f and g were arbitrary decreasing functions, we’ve shown that the composition of any two decreasing functions is increasing.)"
Prove that the sum of any two decreasing functions is decreasing. (writing things a little more compactly than in the previous problem).,"Let f and g be decreasing functions, and x < y. As f is decreasing, f(x) > f(y) Likewise g(x) > g(y) Adding these two inequalities together, we see that (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) > f(y) + g(y) = (f + g)(y), so f + g is decreasing."
"Prove that the function g : N → N, defined by g(n) = bn/3c, is surjective.","To prove a function, f : A → B is surjective, or onto, we must show f(A) = B. In other words, we must show the two sets, f(A) and B, are equal. We already know that f(A) ⊆ B if f is a well-defined function. While most functions encountered in a course using algebraic functions are well-defined, this should not be an automatic assumption in general. With that said, though, we will usually assume the functions given to us are well defined, so all that must be shown is that B ⊆ f(A). To do this we may use the definition of a subset: show every element of B is also an element of f(A). Thus we begin the proof by fixing an arbitrary element of B. We then use the tools at our disposal (definition of the function, algebra, any other known information) to show that this arbitrary element must in fact be the image of some element of A.

Proof. Let n ∈ N. Notice that g(3n) = b(3n)/3c = b(3n)/3c = n. Since 3n ∈ N, this shows n is in the range of g. Hence g is surjective."
"Recall that a real polynomial of degree n is a real-valued function of the form f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anx n , in which the ak are real constants and an 6= 0. A real zero of such a polynomial is a real number b such that f(b) = 0.","Suppose such a real polynomial f(x) of degree n and with an = 1 has n distinct real zeros, b1 < ... < bn. Let [c, d] be an interval such that c < b1 < ... < bn < d, Then there is a positive number ε > 0 such that if g(x) is any differentiable function for which |g(x)| < ε, for every x ∈ [c, d], then f(x) + g(x) has at least n zeros in [c, d]. 

Proof: We do this in Steps Step One: f (x ) = (x − b1 )(x − b2 )...(x − bn). You may already have seen this, but in any case I am going to prove it a little later, and so will skip the proof for now. 

Step Two: In each of the intervals [c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d], f (x )is never zero and therefore has constant sign. 

proof: Since f(x) = (x − b1)(x − b2)...(x − bn), it follows that f(x) is non-zero in each of these intervals. Moreover, if there were two points x < y in one of these intervals at which f had opposite signs, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for some z between x and y, it would be true that f(z) was zero, which is not the case. Step Three: The values f 0 (bk ) of the derivative of f are non-zero. proof: Write f(x) = (x − bk)h(x). By the product rule, f 0 (bk) = h(bk) 6= 0. Step Four: The signs of the values of f(x) in the intervals (c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d) alternate from interval to interval. proof: First consider the case that f(x) is positive in the interval to the right of bk. Then we compute the derivative at bk by taking the limit as x approaches bk from the right: f 0 (bk) = limh→0 f(bk + h) − f(bk) h ≥ 0. Since f 0 (bk) 6= 0, f0 (bk) > 0. Since the derivative at bk is positive the function must be increasing in an interval around bk. Since its value at bk is zero, it must be negative in the interval to the left of bk. The other case is when f(x) is negative in the interval to the right of bk. Then, when we compute the derivative as a limit from the right we see that f 0 (bk) ≤ 0 and so it must be negative. In this case the function is decreasing near bk, and so it must be positive to the left. Step Five: Completion of the proof: Pick any numbers: y0 ∈ (c, b1) yi ∈ (bi , bi+1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and yn ∈ (bn, d). Then each f(yi) 6= 0. Choose ε to be a positive number such that ε < |f(yi)|, i = 0, · · · , n. Now suppose g(x) is any differentiable function in the interval [c, d] such that |g(x)| < ε, for every x ∈ [c, d]. 
Then for each i, f(yi)+g(yi) has the same sign as f(yi). Therefore, f(yi)+g(yi) and f(yi+1) + g(yi+1) have opposite signs. Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there are points zi in the intervals (yi , yi+1) such that (f + g)(zi) = 0. q.e.d."
There are infinitely many distinct prime numbers.,"Proof. Suppose that there are finitely many distinct primes p1, p2.....pr. Consider c = p1p2...pr + 1. Clearly c > 1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, c is divisible by at least one prime, say p1. Then c = p1d for some d ∈ Z. Hence we have p1(d − p2...pr) = c − p1p2..pr = 1. This is a contradiction as no prime divides 1. Hence there are infinitely many distinct primes."
"The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 5/4. If a few boys leave the class, the ratio of boys to girls would become the reciprocal of the earlier ratio, which of the following CANNOT be the possible number of boys and girls in the class?","In this problem, we have a class with 5 times x boys and 4 times x girls initially. Let y be the number of boys who leave the class.
We form an equation based on the reciprocal ratio of 54 to 45, which simplifies to:
""25x - 5y"" equals ""16x"".
By rearranging, we find:
""9x"" equals ""5y"".
Since x and y are positive integers, we identify possible pairs such as (5, 9), (10, 18), (15, 27), (20, 36), and so on.
The total number of boys and girls in the class is represented by ""9x"". For different values of x, we calculate:
""9x"" gives ""45, 90, 135, 180, ..."".
Therefore, the possible numbers of boys and girls in the class are 45, 90, 135, 180, etc. The number 120 is not among the possible combinations based on the values derived from ""9x""."
"If n is a natural number and n > 1, prove that n 3 − 1 is divisible by n − 1.","Proof: let n be a natural number and suppose n > 1. Direct multiplication gives (n − 1)(n^2 + n + 1) = n^3 − 1. Since n^2 + n + 1 is a natural number, n^3 − 1 is divisible by n − 1. q.e.d."
Prove that if x is a real number and x > 1 then x^2 > x.,"Proof: x^2 − x = x(x − 1). Since x > 1, x and x − 1 are both positive. Therefore x(x − 1) is positive. Therefore x^2 > x. q.e.d."
"Prove If p < n are natural numbers then for some natural number m ≤ n and for some integer r with 0 ≤ r < p, n=mp +r. (The number r is called the remainder.)","Let p < n be natural numbers. If k > n then for any r ≥ 0 kp ≥ k > n. Thus if mp + r = n it must be true that mp ≤ n and so m ≤ n. Since 1 ≤ n we can choose m to be the largest natural number such that mp ≤ n. Then n − mp ≥ 0. On the other hand, if n − mp ≥ p then (n − mp) − p > 0 and so n − (m + 1)p = (n − mp) − p > 0. Thus m was not the largest natural number which multiplied by p gave an answer at most n, and we assumed it was. Thus n − mp < p and we may set r = n − mp. q.e.d."
"To preserve the ecological balance of a reserve, a number of lions were released in the reserve in 2000. Initially, there were only 5 lions in the reserve. After the observation of a few years, a function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 was developed to represent the number of lions in the reserve, where L(n)
represents the number of lions and n
 represents the number of years after which they were released. Assume that no lion died during this period. Based on the above function, which of the following statements are correct? (without calculator)


* 10 lions were released in the reserve in 2000.
* The increase in the number of lions in the third year was 8.
* The total number of lions in the beginning of the third year was 27.","Given: L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
The function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 represents the number of lions in the reserve

This is a quadratic function. The constant term in the function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.'

Let's expand the function and get the value of the constant term.

L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
=>L(n)=n^2+2n+1+n+1+15
=>L(n)=n^2+3n+17
So, '17' represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.' Thus, the number of lions released in the reserve =17−5=12≠8.
Thus, Statement I incorrect.

Let's move to Statement II: The increase in the number of lions in the third year was 8.

The increase in the number of lions in the third year

=L(3)−L(2)=[3^2+3×3+17]−[2^2+3×2+17]=8.
Thus, Statement II is correct.

Let's move to Statement III: The total number of lions in the beginning of the third year was 27.

The statement ""The total number of lions in the beginning of the third year was 27"" means ""the total number of lions by the end of the second year was 27.""

Thus, by plugging-in the value of n=2 
in L(n)=n^2+3n+17
, we get

L(2)=2^2+3×2+17=4+6+17=27."

(−15/2) ≤x−7≤ (1/2)
Taking the absolute values, we get

∣(−15/2)∣ ≤|x−7|≤ ∣1/2∣
(15/2) ≤|x−7|≤ (1/2)
The greatest of the two values (15/2)

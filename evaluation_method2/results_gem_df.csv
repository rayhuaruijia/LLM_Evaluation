Proof: We do this in Steps Step One: f (x ) = (x − b1 )(x − b2 )...(x − bn). You may already have seen this, but in any case I am going to prove it a little later, and so will skip the proof for now. 

Step Two: In each of the intervals [c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d], f (x )is never zero and therefore has constant sign. 

proof: Since f(x) = (x − b1)(x − b2)...(x − bn), it follows that f(x) is non-zero in each of these intervals. Moreover, if there were two points x < y in one of these intervals at which f had opposite signs, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for some z between x and y, it would be true that f(z) was zero, which is not the case. Step Three: The values f 0 (bk ) of the derivative of f are non-zero. proof: Write f(x) = (x − bk)h(x). By the product rule, f 0 (bk) = h(bk) 6= 0. Step Four: The signs of the values of f(x) in the intervals (c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d) alternate from interval to interval. proof: First consider the case that f(x) is positive in the interval to the right of bk. Then we compute the derivative at bk by taking the limit as x approaches bk from the right: f 0 (bk) = limh→0 f(bk + h) − f(bk) h ≥ 0. Since f 0 (bk) 6= 0, f0 (bk) > 0. Since the derivative at bk is positive the function must be increasing in an interval around bk. Since its value at bk is zero, it must be negative in the interval to the left of bk. The other case is when f(x) is negative in the interval to the right of bk. Then, when we compute the derivative as a limit from the right we see that f 0 (bk) ≤ 0 and so it must be negative. In this case the function is decreasing near bk, and so it must be positive to the left. Step Five: Completion of the proof: Pick any numbers: y0 ∈ (c, b1) yi ∈ (bi , bi+1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and yn ∈ (bn, d). Then each f(yi) 6= 0. Choose ε to be a positive number such that ε < |f(yi)|, i = 0, · · · , n. Now suppose g(x) is any differentiable function in the interval [c, d] such that |g(x)| < ε, for every x ∈ [c, d]. 
Then for each i, f(yi)+g(yi) has the same sign as f(yi). Therefore, f(yi)+g(yi) and f(yi+1) + g(yi+1) have opposite signs. Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there are points zi in the intervals (yi , yi+1) such that (f + g)(zi) = 0. q.e.d.",1,10.64,10.728,0.7042664012,0.5494134381,0.79611415,0.2622222222,"```json

The function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15

This is a quadratic function. The constant term in the function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.'

Let's expand the function and get the value of the constant term.

L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
=>L(n)=n^2+2n+1+n+1+15
=>L(n)=n^2+3n+17
So, '17' represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.' Thus, the number of lions released in the reserve =17−5=12≠8.
Thus, Statement I incorrect.

Let's move to Statement II: The increase in the number of lions in the third year was 8.

The increase in the number of lions in the third year

{""My Answer"": ""There are 35 cats and 25 dogs in the shelter."", ""Explanation"": ""Let's assume there are 7x cats and 5x dogs in the shelter. After a few cats are adopted, the ratio becomes 5/7. This means the number of cats now is 5y and the number of dogs remains 5x. Since the number of dogs doesn't change, 5x = 5y, implying x = y. Now, the difference between the initial number of cats and the final number of cats is 7x - 5x = 2x. This difference is the number of cats adopted. Since the ratio of cats to dogs changes to its reciprocal, the number of cats adopted must be a multiple of 2. To find the smallest possible solution, we can assume 2x = 2, which means x = 1. This results in 7x = 7 * 1 = 7 cats and 5x = 5 * 1 = 5 dogs initially. After adopting 2 cats, there are 5 cats and 5 dogs. However, the ratio remains the same, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, we need to consider a larger multiple of 2 for 2x. Let's try 2x = 4, which means x = 2. This results in 7x = 7 * 2 = 14 cats and 5x = 5 * 2 = 10 dogs initially. After adopting 4 cats, there are 10 cats and 10 dogs, which still doesn't satisfy the condition. Continuing this process, we find that for 2x = 10, x = 5, which gives us 7x = 7 * 5 = 35 cats and 5x = 5 * 5 = 25 dogs initially. After adopting 10 cats, there are 25 cats and 25 dogs, making the ratio 5/7. Therefore, there were initially 35 cats and 25 dogs in the shelter.""}

{""My Answer"": ""There are 70 cats and 50 dogs in the shelter."", ""Explanation"": ""Let the initial number of cats be 7x and the initial number of dogs be 5x. After some cats are adopted, the ratio of cats to dogs becomes 5/7.  This means that the number of cats after adoption is 5y and the number of dogs is 7y.  The difference between the initial number of cats and the number of cats after adoption is the number of cats adopted, which is 7x - 5y.  We can set up an equation to represent this: 7x - 5y = 0.  We also know that the ratio of cats to dogs is reciprocal, so we can set up another equation: 5x / 7y = 5/7.  Solving this equation, we find that x = y.  Substituting this into the first equation, we get 7x - 5x = 0, which simplifies to 2x = 0.  Solving for x, we get x = 0.  This is not a valid solution, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.  Since the ratio of cats to dogs is reciprocal, it means the number of cats after adoption is equal to the initial number of dogs, and vice versa.  Therefore, the initial number of cats is 70 and the initial number of dogs is 50.  This is the only possible solution that satisfies the given conditions.""}

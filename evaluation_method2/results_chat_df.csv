"Recall that a real polynomial of degree n is a real-valued function of the form f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anx n , in which the ak are real constants and an 6= 0. A real zero of such a polynomial is a real number b such that f(b) = 0.Format your response as follows: '{""My Answer"": ""<answer>"", ""Explanation"": ""<explanation>""","Suppose such a real polynomial f(x) of degree n and with an = 1 has n distinct real zeros, b1 < ... < bn. Let [c, d] be an interval such that c < b1 < ... < bn < d, Then there is a positive number ε > 0 such that if g(x) is any differentiable function for which |g(x)| < ε, for every x ∈ [c, d], then f(x) + g(x) has at least n zeros in [c, d]. 

Proof: We do this in Steps Step One: f (x ) = (x − b1 )(x − b2 )...(x − bn). You may already have seen this, but in any case I am going to prove it a little later, and so will skip the proof for now. 

Step Two: In each of the intervals [c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d], f (x )is never zero and therefore has constant sign. 

proof: Since f(x) = (x − b1)(x − b2)...(x − bn), it follows that f(x) is non-zero in each of these intervals. Moreover, if there were two points x < y in one of these intervals at which f had opposite signs, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for some z between x and y, it would be true that f(z) was zero, which is not the case. Step Three: The values f 0 (bk ) of the derivative of f are non-zero. proof: Write f(x) = (x − bk)h(x). By the product rule, f 0 (bk) = h(bk) 6= 0. Step Four: The signs of the values of f(x) in the intervals (c, b1 ),(b1 , b2 ), ...,(bn, d) alternate from interval to interval. proof: First consider the case that f(x) is positive in the interval to the right of bk. Then we compute the derivative at bk by taking the limit as x approaches bk from the right: f 0 (bk) = limh→0 f(bk + h) − f(bk) h ≥ 0. Since f 0 (bk) 6= 0, f0 (bk) > 0. Since the derivative at bk is positive the function must be increasing in an interval around bk. Since its value at bk is zero, it must be negative in the interval to the left of bk. The other case is when f(x) is negative in the interval to the right of bk. Then, when we compute the derivative as a limit from the right we see that f 0 (bk) ≤ 0 and so it must be negative. In this case the function is decreasing near bk, and so it must be positive to the left. Step Five: Completion of the proof: Pick any numbers: y0 ∈ (c, b1) yi ∈ (bi , bi+1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and yn ∈ (bn, d). Then each f(yi) 6= 0. Choose ε to be a positive number such that ε < |f(yi)|, i = 0, · · · , n. Now suppose g(x) is any differentiable function in the interval [c, d] such that |g(x)| < ε, for every x ∈ [c, d]. 
Then for each i, f(yi)+g(yi) has the same sign as f(yi). Therefore, f(yi)+g(yi) and f(yi+1) + g(yi+1) have opposite signs. Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there are points zi in the intervals (yi , yi+1) such that (f + g)(zi) = 0. q.e.d.",0.6,14.24,16.156,0.8279062426,0.7054143042,0.7413384,0.2355555556,"{""My Answer"": ""A real zero of a polynomial is a real number that makes the polynomial equal to zero when plugged into the function."", ""Explanation"": ""This definition clarifies what is meant by a real zero of a polynomial and emphasizes that it is a value that causes the function to output zero.""}","{""My Answer"": ""b is a real zero of the polynomial f(x)"", ""Explanation"": ""This statement is true because a real zero of a polynomial is a number that makes the polynomial equal to zero when evaluated at that number.""}","{""My Answer"": ""A real zero of a polynomial is a real number that makes the polynomial equal to 0 when substituted into the polynomial function."", ""Explanation"": ""This definition of a real zero aligns with the mathematical understanding of roots or solutions of a polynomial equation where f(b) = 0.""}","{""My Answer"": ""A real zero of a polynomial is a value of x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero, meaning f(x) = 0."", ""Explanation"": ""This definition is key in understanding real zeros of polynomials as they are simply the values of x that make the polynomial equation equal to zero.""}","{""My Answer"": ""A real zero of a polynomial function is a value of x that makes the function equal to zero, in other words, it is a root of the polynomial equation f(x) = 0."", ""Explanation"": ""A real zero of a polynomial function is a value of x that makes the function equal to zero, in other words, it is a root of the polynomial equation f(x) = 0.

The function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 represents the number of lions in the reserve

This is a quadratic function. The constant term in the function L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
 represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.'

Let's expand the function and get the value of the constant term.

L(n)=(n+1)^2+(n+1)+15
=>L(n)=n^2+2n+1+n+1+15
=>L(n)=n^2+3n+17
So, '17' represents 'the number of lions initially present plus the number of lions released in the reserve.' Thus, the number of lions released in the reserve =17−5=12≠8.
Thus, Statement I incorrect.

Let's move to Statement II: The increase in the number of lions in the third year was 8.

The increase in the number of lions in the third year

=L(3)−L(2)=[3^2+3×3+17]−[2^2+3×2+17]=8.

"If |2x−7|≤8 what is the greatest possible value of |x−7|? (without calculator) show work.Format your response as follows: '{""My Answer"": ""<answer>"", ""Explanation"": ""<explanation>""","Given: |2x−7|≤8
±(2x−7)≤8
Case 1: Taking (2x−7)
 as positive

(2x−7)≤8
=>x≤ (15/2)
Case 2: Taking (2x−7)
 as negative

−(2x−7)≤8
−(2x−7)≤8; multiplying the inequality by −1; note the change of sign of the equality

Let n be a natural number.

We can rewrite n^4 - n^2 as n^2(n^2 - 1).
Since n is a natural number, n^2 is always even (as it is the square of a natural number).
n^2 - 1 can be written as (n + 1)(n - 1), which is the product of two consecutive natural numbers.
One of n+1 or n-1 is always even since one number is odd and the other is even.
Therefore, n^2 - 1 is always divisible by 2.

Since n^2 is even and n^2 - 1 is also divisible by 2, the expression n^4 - n^2 is divisible by 2.

Therefore, n^4 - n^2 is divisible by 2 for any natural number n.

Case 1: If n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. 
Substitute n = 2k into the expression n^4 - n^2:
(2k)^4 - (2k)^2 = 16k^4 - 4k^2 = 4(4k^4 - k^2)

Since k is an integer, 4k^4 - k^2 is also an integer, so n^4 - n^2 is divisible by 2 when n is even.

Case 2: If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. 
Substitute n = 2k + 1 into the expression n^4 - n^2:
(2k + 1)^4 - (2k + 1)^2 = (16k^4 + 8k^3 + 8k^2 + 1) - (4k^2 + 4k + 1) = 16k^4 + 8k^3 + 4k^2 - 4k

      "Gemini's resonse:Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:  1. Calculate the purchase price per share:   The face value of each share is Rs. 50.  There's a 5% discount, so the discount amount is (5/100) x 50 = Rs. 2.50  The purchase price per share is Rs. 50 - Rs. 2.50 = Rs. 47.50  2. Calculate the total investment:   The man bought 20 shares at Rs. 47.50 each, so his total investment is 20 x 47.50 = Rs. 950  3. Calculate the annual dividend income:   The dividend rate is 13%, which means he earns 13/100 x 50 = Rs. 6.50 per share as dividend.  His total dividend income is 20 x 6.50 = Rs. 130  4. Calculate the rate of interest:   Rate of interest is calculated as (Dividend Income / Total Investment) x 100  So, the rate of interest is (130 / 950) x 100 = 13.68% (approximately)  Therefore, the rate of interest obtained is approximately 13.68%.  \n",

      "Gemini's resonse:Here's how to solve the problem:  Understanding the Problem  The problem asks us to find the percentage that, when multiplied by 360, equals 108.   Setting up the Equation  Let \"x\" represent the unknown percentage. We can write the problem as an equation:  x% of 360 = 108  Converting Percentage to Decimal  Remember that a percentage is a fraction out of 100.  To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100:  x% = x/100  Solving for x  Now our equation becomes:  (x/100) x 360 = 108  Simplify:  3.6x = 108  To isolate x, divide both sides by 3.6:  x = 108 / 3.6  x = 30  Answer  Therefore, 30% of 360 equals 108.  \n",

      "Correct option: a\n",
      "Gemini's resonse:Here's how to solve the problem:  Understanding the Problem   We start with 9 liters of a liquid that is 50% acidic. This means half of the liquid is acid, and the other half is water.  We want to add water to dilute the acid concentration to 30%.  Setting up the Equation  Let 'x' be the quantity of water (in liters) that needs to be added.   Initial Acid: 9 liters x 50% = 4.5 liters of acid   Final Volume: 9 liters + x liters = (9 + x) liters  Final Acid Concentration: 4.5 liters / (9 + x) liters = 30%  Solving for x  1. Convert percentage to decimal: 30% = 0.30 2. Set up the equation: 4.5 / (9 + x) = 0.30 3. Multiply both sides by (9 + x): 4.5 = 0.30 (9 + x) 4. Distribute: 4.5 = 2.7 + 0.30x 5. Subtract 2.7 from both sides: 1.8 = 0.30x 6. Divide both sides by 0.30: x = 6  Answer  You need to add 6 liters of water to reduce the 9 liters of 50% acidic liquid to a 30% acidic liquid.  \n",

To make 108x a perfect cube, we need to ensure that all the prime factors in its prime factorization appear in groups of three.  Finding x   We already have three 3's (3³) in the prime factorization of 108.  We have two 2's (2²). To make a group of three, we need one more 2.  Therefore, x must be equal to 2 to make the prime factorization of 108x  be 2³ x 3³. This results in:  108  2 = 216 = 6³  Answer  The smallest positive integer x that makes 108x a perfect cube is x = 2.  \n",

      "Correct option: b\n",
      "Gemini's resonse:Here's how to solve this problem:  1. Understand the Setup   Two people are walking towards each other on a track.  A goods train is moving along the same track.  The train passes the first person in 20 seconds.  10 minutes later, the train passes the second person in 18 seconds.  2.  Key Concepts   Relative Speed: When objects move towards each other, their speeds add up to determine how quickly they close the distance between them.  Distance = Speed x Time:  We can use this formula to relate the distance the train travels and its speed.  3.  Let's Assign Variables   Let 'x' be the speed of the train (in meters per second).  Let 'y' be the speed of the first person (in meters per second).  Let 'z' be the speed of the second person (in meters per second).  4.  Formulate Equations   Equation 1:  The train crosses the first person in 20 seconds:      Distance traveled by train = x x 20     This distance is also the length of the train (let's call it 'L').       So, L = 20x   Equation 2:  The train crosses the second person in 18 seconds:     Distance traveled by train = x x 18      This is again the length of the train (L), so L = 18x   Equation 3:  The train traveled for 10 minutes (600 seconds) between crossing the two people.  During this time, the two people are closing the distance between them.     Distance traveled by the train in 600 seconds = x x 600     Total distance covered by the two people in 600 seconds = (y + z) x 600  Since the train traveled the same distance in both cases, we can equate the distances from Equations 1 and 2:   20x = 18x  Solving for x, we find that x = 0. This means the train is stationary. This is a bit of a trick question!    5.  Finding When the Two People Will Meet  Since the train is stationary, we only need to consider the relative speed of the two people.  Let's assume they are moving at a constant speed.   Relative Speed:  y + z   To find when they will meet, we need to know the distance between them initially.  Since that information is not provided, we can't calculate an exact time.   Conclusion  The problem is a bit of a trick! The train is stationary, which makes it impossible to find a definite time when the two people will meet. We would need to know the initial distance between them.  \n",

      "Gemini's resonse:Here's how to solve the problem:  Understanding the Problem:   Two trains are traveling towards each other.  They meet at a point 110 km from one station, which means they've covered a combined distance of 110 km.  Since the total distance between the stations is 200 km, the remaining distance covered by the second train is 200 km - 110 km = 90 km.  Setting up the Equations:  Let:   'x' be the speed of the first train  'y' be the speed of the second train   Time is the same for both trains:  Since they start at the same time and meet, the time taken by each train to reach the meeting point is the same.  Distance = Speed x Time: We can use this formula to relate distance, speed, and time for each train.  Calculations:   Train 1: Distance = 110 km, Speed = x, Time = t (unknown)  Train 2: Distance = 90 km, Speed = y, Time = t (unknown)  Using the formula Distance = Speed x Time for both trains:   110 = x  t   90 = y  t  Finding the Ratio:  To find the ratio of their speeds (x/y), we need to eliminate the time (t).  We can do this by dividing the first equation by the second equation:  (110 / x  t) / (90 / y  t) = 1  Simplifying:  110y / 90x = 1  Cross-multiplying:  110y = 90x  Now, solve for the ratio x/y:  x/y = 110/90  Simplifying the Ratio:  The ratio of their speeds can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (10):  x/y = 11/9  Answer:  The ratio of the speeds of the two trains is 11:9.  \n",
